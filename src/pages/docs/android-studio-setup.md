# Android Studio Setup

This section will focus on installing the Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and ensuring it is prepared for ATAK plugin development.

## Install Android Studio

Follow the guide provided by the official documents [https://developer.android.com/studio/install](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) for your operating system using the default choices. Below are operating system requirements for the current most stable version of *Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1* at the time of writing. The figures in this documentation will showcase this version of Android Studio; however utilizing the latest version is recommended and changes to the IDE should not be significant.

System Requirements:

- 8 GB RAM or more
- 8 GB of available disk space minimum (IDE + Android SDK + Android Emulator)
- 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution
- Windows Specific:
  - 64-bit Microsoft® Windows® 8/10
  - x86_64 CPU architecture; 2nd generation Intel Core or newer, or AMD CPU with support for a Windows [Hypervisor.Framework](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#vm-windows)

## Setup for ATAK Development

1. Install Android SDK 21. *Since ATAK requires a minimum version of Android 5.0 / API level 21 / Lollipop.*

   On the home *Projects* page, select *More Actions* dropdown and select *SDK Manager* to open the settings dialog.
   On the new dialog `Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK` page, select *Android 5.0 (Lollipop) API Level 21* then click *Apply* to download.

2. Quick Documentation on Mouse Hover. *As a convenience functionality of the Android Studio IDE enabling this feature will allow you to hover your mouse cursor over function calls, constants or object instances to display a tooltip showing the Java Documentation for the code item.*
   On the home *Customize* page, select "All settings..." to open the settings dialog.
   On the new dialog `Editor > Code Editing` page, ensure the "Show quick documentation on hover" option is selected under the *Quick Documentation* section then click *Apply* if necessary.
