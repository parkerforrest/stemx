## Overview

Students will be invited to attend an extracurricular event called "Pi in the Sky." The event will take place at a prototyping garage in Jacksonville Beach, FL, and students will get to participate in a real world role playing game where the goal is to learn and apply engineering solutions to solve real world problems.

Students will be provided with the instructions, sensors and hardware, and subject matter expert coaches to build solutions that integrate with Team Awareness Kit (TAK). Their coaches will inspire them to solve challeges that have real world application, such as informing first responders with precision maps and situational awareness in disastor scenarios.

The events will allow for students to interact in person with their peers and coaches to work through challenges and get immediate feedback, but an online platform will be developed as well where students will be able to participate virtually.

## Weekend 0 - Orientation

Parents will be invited to an information session via zoom where the program goals and logistics will be explained to them. They'll be incentivized to encourage their students participation by the scholarship and education opportunity. They will be asked to complete some paperwork and given a calendar of events so they know what to expect.

**Weekend Results:**
Students have created and customized their profile on the web platform.
Parents have signed forms and are incentivized to bring their students to events

## Weekend 1 - "Pi Aware"

### Friday Night Kickoff (6:30-8pm)

- Welcome and introductiton
- Introduction to game/story, teammates, TAK, learning platform, skill tree
- Learn how professionals are using TAK in different scenarios

### Saturday Bootcamp (8am-Noon)

- Introduction to Python and Shell scripting
- Kit #1 Unboxing: Pi, antennae, hardware filters
- Students Hello World
- Initial hands on with building a software defined radio - PiAware
- Award badges for participation, silently score students for other metrics of interest such as grit, leadership, etc.
- Teaser for tomorrow
  - Fly drones outside and show the students the video and maps pop up on their ATAK devices
  - Explain how we're going to get the data from the SDR they just built and display it on TAK

### Sunday Bootcamp (1pm-4pm)

- Introduction to ATAK, Java, and Linux programming
- Make a TAK plugin that displays the plane data on the TAK Server
- Capture the flag game / Ingress / Space Team mechanics game where students have to go out to a public area and coordinate with one another via TAK (messaging, cameras, plugins) to find and unlock hidden boxes
- Teaser for next weekend
  - Show how cameras can do object detection of cars vs people

**Weekend Results:**

- Students have advanced along the skill tree
- Python development

  - Parking space counter camera and timeline

### Sunday Bootcamp (1pm-4pm)

- Introduce the Pi Competition where students will choose real world challenges and design solutions with what they have learned
- Computer Vision solutions integrated with TAK
- Work 1:1 with students to outline architectures and approaches

**Weekend Results:**

- Students have advanced along the skill tree
- AI branch
- Students have learned about the building blocks of AI and how it can be relevant in disaster relief or situational awareness applications
- Students have a "Smarie Pi" kit where they can begin experimenting with computer vision
- Students are excited to come back and compete for scholarship money

## Weekend 3 - "Pi Competition"

### Saturday Bootcamp

- Help students get unstuck with their Pi Competition builds
